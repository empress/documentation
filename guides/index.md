Welcome to the Empress documentation. This is here to give you an overview of Empress, list some of the official _Empress Products_ that are out there and hopefully give you an idea of the general architecture of Empress.

There will also be some more in-depth guides on how to do things in Empress, like how to write templates for each of the Empress products, or how to add search capability, and other more advanced topics.

Also remember that this is **living documentation** so if you ever want to suggest an edit you can click the pencil icon in the top right of any page or you can make a "documentation request" by [opening an issue on the GitHub page](https://github.com/empress/documentation).

##Â What is Empress

Empress is [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com)' answer to the JAMStack. The name is inspired by VuePress and is a combination of Ember and Press, and is why we have one of the [coolest Zoey mascots](https://emberjs.com/mascots/#empress) out there!

Because Ember is an all-in-one platform that already had a robust Server-Side Rendering (using [FastBoot](https://ember-fastboot.com/)) and Server-Side Generation (using [prember](https://github.com/ef4/prember)) we didn't need any new low-level building blocks to allow people to be able to make their apps work for SSR or SSG.

Instead of being a low-level building block, Empress is a set of "products" that are each designed to serve a particular use-case very well. Each Empress product shares some core architectural decisions so they should all feel quite familiar, and they are all equally focused on providing the best possible solution for maximising SEO.

In the next section I will go into more detail on what it means to be an Empress Product and list the current "official" products.
